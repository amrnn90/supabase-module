## Vue composables

This module provides composables to use inside vour `vue` files. Those exposed composables are [auto-imported](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/directory-structure/composables) by Nuxt 3.

### `useSupabaseClient`

This composable is using [supabase-js](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/) under the hood, it gives acces to the [Supabase client](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/supabase-client).

```vue [pages/index.vue]
<script setup>
const client = useSupabaseClient()

// Example: client.from('librairies').eq('name', 'Vue').single()
</script>
```

<br>

**Authentification**

All authentification methods are available on [Supabase Auth](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signup) Documentation.

Here is an example of the login using the `signIn` method with [third-party providers](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signin#sign-in-using-third-party-providers).

```vue [pages/login.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const user = useSupabaseUser()
const client = useSupabaseClient()
const router = useRouter()

// Login method using providers
const login = async (provider: 'github' | 'google' | 'gitlab' | 'bitbucket') => {
  const { error } = await client.auth.signIn({ provider })

  if (error) {
    return alert('Something went wrong !')
  }

  router.push('/dashboard')
}
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="login('github')">Login with GitHub</button>
</template>
```

<alert type="info">

Thanks to the [Nuxt plugin](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/directory-structure/plugins), we are listening to the [onAuthStateChange](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-onauthstatechange) listener in order to update the user value according to the received event. We also keep the session consistency between client and server side.

 **Database Request**

Please check [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/select) documentation to fully use the power of Supabase client.

Here is an example of a fetch using the `select` method with Nuxt 3 [useAsyncData](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/usage/data-fetching#useasyncdata) composable.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const user = useSupabaseUser()
const client = useSupabaseClient()

const { data: restaurant } } = await useAsyncData('restaurant', async () => {
  const { data } = await client.from('restaurants').select('name, location').eq('name', 'My Restaurant Name').single()

  return data
})
</script>
```

### `useSupabaseUser`

Once logged in, you can access your user everywhere:

```vue
<script setup>
const user = useSupabaseUser()
</script>
```

## Server routes services

> This section assumes you're familiar with [Nitro](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/concepts/server-engine#standalone-server), the server engine powered by Nuxt.

In order to provide utilities similar to `vue` composables in [server routes](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/features/server-routes/), this module exposes services providing the same functionnalities.

### `serverSupabaseClient`

This function is working similary as the [useSupabaseClient](/usage#usesupabaseclient) composable but is designed to be used in server routes.

Define your server route and just import the `serverSupabaseClient` from `#supabase/server`.

```ts [server/api/librairies.ts]
import { serverSupabaseClient } from '#supabase/server'

export default eventHandler(async (event) => {
  const client = serverSupabaseClient(event)

  const { data } = client.from('librairies').select()

  return { librairies: data }
})
```

Then call your API route from any vue file:

```ts [pages/index.vue]
const fetchLibrairy = async () => {
  const { librairies } = await $fetch('/api/librairies')
}
```

Be careful, if you want to call this route on SSR, please read this [section](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/features/data-fetching/#isomorphic-fetch-and-fetch), you must send your browser cookies including you supabase token.

```ts [pages/index.vue]
const { data: { librairies }} = await useFetch('/api/librairies', {
  headers: useRequestHeaders(['cookie'])
})
```

### `serverSupabaseServiceRoleClient`

Similar to [serverSupabaseClient](/usage#serverSupabaseClient) but uses the service role key provided via the `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` environment variable. This client has the ability to bypass [RLS](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security)  and should only be used when you want to perform actions not authorized by the currently signed in user or when responding to webhooks where there is no active user session.

Define your server route and just import the `serverSupabaseServiceRoleClient` from `#supabase/server`.

```ts [server/api/librairies.ts]
import { serverSupabaseServiceRoleClient } from '#supabase/server'

export default eventHandler(async (event) => {
  const client = serverSupabaseServiceRoleClient(event)

  return await client.from("stripe_customers").create({
    customer_id: "XYZ",
    is_subscribed: true
  })
})
```


### `serverSupabaseUser`

This function is working similary as the [useSupabaseUser](/usage#usesupabaseuser) composable but is designed to be used in server routes.

Define your server route and just use the `serverSupabaseUser` like:

```ts [server/api/me.ts]
import { serverSupabaseUser } from '#supabase/server'

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  return await serverSupabaseUser(event)
})
```

Then call your api route from any vue file:

```ts [pages/index.vue]
const user = ref(null)

const fetchMe = async () => {
   user.value = await $fetch('/api/me')
}
```

Be careful, if you want to call this route on SSR, please read this [section](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/features/data-fetching/#isomorphic-fetch-and-fetch), you must send your browser cookies including you supabase token.

```ts [pages/index.vue]
const user = ref(null)

const { data } = await useFetch('/api/me', {
  headers: useRequestHeaders(['cookie'])
})

user.value = data
```
